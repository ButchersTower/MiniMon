MiniMon
=========

Pokemon clone.

Two Aspects:

Moving :: Fighting

Both very shitty.

There are two pokemon and three attacks.

Your pokemon knows two of the attacks and theirs knows one.

The damage is calculated close to autheticly. It lacks Same Type Attack Bonus and Type Advantages.

Adding other moves and pokemon is simple just im just not dedicated to put in that time.

Needs - Combining of two program - UI - STAB/ Type Advantage - Items (Backpack/ Pokemon) - Stat chaging abilities (Grown ect.) -
